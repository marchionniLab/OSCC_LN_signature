TI  - The role of HPV RNA transcription, immune response-related gene expression and 
      disruptive TP53 mutations in diagnostic and prognostic profiling of head and neck 
      cancer.

AB  - Stratification of head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC) based on HPV16 DNA 
      and RNA status, gene expression patterns, and mutated candidate genes may facilitate 
      patient treatment decision. We characterize head and neck squamous cell carcinomas 
      (HNSCC) with different HPV16 DNA and RNA (E6*I) status from 290 consecutively 
      recruited patients by gene expression profiling and targeted sequencing of 50 genes. 
      We show that tumors with transcriptionally inactive HPV16 (DNA+ RNA-) are similar to 
      HPV-negative (DNA-) tumors regarding gene expression and frequency of TP53 mutations 
      (47%, 8/17 and 43%, 72/167, respectively). We also find that an immune 
      response-related gene expression cluster is associated with lymph node metastasis, 
      independent of HPV16 status and that disruptive TP53 mutations are associated with 
      lymph node metastasis in HPV16 DNA- tumors. We validate each of these associations 
      in another large data set. Four gene expression clusters which we identify differ 
      moderately but significantly in overall survival. Our findings underscore the 
      importance of measuring the HPV16 RNA (E6*I) and TP53-mutation status for patient 
      stratification and identify associations of an immune response-related gene 
      expression cluster and TP53 mutations with lymph node metastasis in HNSCC.
