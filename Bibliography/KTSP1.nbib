TI  - Simple decision rules for classifying human cancers from gene expression profiles.
PG  - 3896-904
AB  - MOTIVATION: Various studies have shown that cancer tissue samples can be 
      successfully detected and classified by their gene expression patterns using machine 
      learning approaches. One of the challenges in applying these techniques for 
      classifying gene expression data is to extract accurate, readily interpretable rules 
      providing biological insight as to how classification is performed. Current methods 
      generate classifiers that are accurate but difficult to interpret. This is the 
      trade-off between credibility and comprehensibility of the classifiers. Here, we 
      introduce a new classifier in order to address these problems. It is referred to as 
      k-TSP (k-Top Scoring Pairs) and is based on the concept of 'relative expression 
      reversals'. This method generates simple and accurate decision rules that only 
      involve a small number of gene-to-gene expression comparisons, thereby facilitating 
      follow-up studies. RESULTS: In this study, we have compared our approach to other 
      machine learning techniques for class prediction in 19 binary and multi-class gene 
      expression datasets involving human cancers. The k-TSP classifier performs as 
      efficiently as Prediction Analysis of Microarray and support vector machine, and 
      outperforms other learning methods (decision trees, k-nearest neighbour and na√Øve 
      Bayes). Our approach is easy to interpret as the classifier involves only a small 
      number of informative genes. For these reasons, we consider the k-TSP method to be a 
      useful tool for cancer classification from microarray gene expression data.
